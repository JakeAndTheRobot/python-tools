# Overview

`keyboard` is a Python library that allows you to control and monitor the keyboard. It can be used to simulate key presses and releases, as well as to detect the state of the keyboard keys.

# Installation

To install the `keyboard` library, you can use `pip`, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

```code
pip install keyboard
```


# Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use the `keyboard` library:

## Simulating key presses

```python
import keyboard

# Press the "a" key.
keyboard.press("a")

# Release the "a" key.
keyboard.release("a")

# Type the word "hello" using the shortcut_key.
keyboard.write("hello")
```

## Monitoring the keyboard

```python
import keyboard

# Check if the "shift" key is being held down.
if keyboard.is_pressed("shift"):
    print("Shift key is being held down")

# Check if the "a" key is being held down.
if keyboard.is_pressed("a"):
    print("A key is being held down")

# Check if the "caps lock" key is turned on.
if keyboard.is_locked("caps lock"):
    print("Caps lock is on")
```
