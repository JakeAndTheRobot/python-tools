- [cheat sheet](https://github.com/JakeAndTheRobot/python-tools/blob/main/tensorflow/cheat-sheet.py)

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for training and deploying machine learning models. It is designed to be flexible, efficient, and portable, and it allows users to define and optimize machine learning models using a variety of high-level and low-level APIs.

TensorFlow is particularly well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks, such as training deep neural networks on massive datasets. It provides support for distributed training, automatic differentiation, and a wide range of optimization algorithms, making it easy to build and deploy machine learning models at scale.

TensorFlow can be used for a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. It is widely used in industry and research, and it has a large and active community of developers and users.
