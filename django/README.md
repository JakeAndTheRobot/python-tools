# Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development of web applications. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, and allows you to focus on writing your app without the need to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source.

Django follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that maps data models to a database and handles database interactions, a template engine for generating HTML, and a view system for defining the business logic of the app. Django also includes a number of built-in features such as authentication, administration, and caching, as well as support for third-party plugins and extensions.

Django is a popular choice for building web applications due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robust feature set. It is used by many large websites, including Instagram and Pinterest.
