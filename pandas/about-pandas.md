# Pandas

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It provides a set of data structures and data analysis tools for handling and manipulating numerical tables and time series data.

Pandas is particularly useful for working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheet or SQL database, and time series data. It provides a range of functions for reading and writing data, filtering and aggregating data, and performing statistical analysis on data.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy, another popular Python library for numerical computing, and provides a high-level interface for working with large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of data. With Pandas, you can easily manipulate and analyze data in a tabular format, perform statistical analysis, and visualize data using a variety of plotting libraries.
