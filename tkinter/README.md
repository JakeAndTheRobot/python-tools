Tkinter is a module in the Python standard library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is built on top of the Tk library, which is a set of libraries for the Tcl programming language. With Tkinter, you can create windows, buttons, menus, and other graphical elements using Python, and you can also interact with these elements using events and callback functions. Tkinter is cross-platform, meaning that it works on many different operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It is a popular choice for creating GUI applications in Python, particularly for beginners.
