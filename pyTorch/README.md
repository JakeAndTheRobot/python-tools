# PyTorch

PyTorch is a powerful open-source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research to production. It is used for applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. To get started with PyTorch, you will need to install it first. You can do this by using the following command:
```code
pip install torch
```
Once you have PyTorch installed, you can import it into your Python code and start building your deep learning models. Here is a simple example of how to use PyTorch to fit a linear regression model:

```python
import torch

# Define the model
model = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=1, out_features=1)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Generate some synthetic data
X = torch.randn(100, 1)
Y = 2*X + 1 + torch.randn(100, 1)

# Train the model
for i in range(100):
  # Forward pass: Compute predicted y by passing x to the model
  Y_pred = model(X)

  # Compute and print loss
  loss = loss_fn(Y_pred, Y)
  print(f'Iteration {i}, loss = {loss.item():.4f}')

  # Zero gradients, perform a backward pass, and update the weights.
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
```

This code defines a simple linear model, then trains it on synthetic data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the mean squared error loss.

There is much more to PyTorch than what I have covered here, but this should give you a good starting point. If you have any further questions or want to learn more, you can refer to the PyTorch documentation
